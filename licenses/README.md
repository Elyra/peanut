The Peanut Collar Distribution is a collection of LSL scripts, and creative content, such as sounds, textures and animations. Below you will find all that you need to know about the terms and conditions for all the individual elements of this collection.

By using the Peanut Collar Distribution, you are confirming your acceptance of Peanut Collar Distribution and agreeing to become bound by the terms of the free and open source software licenses, EULA agreements, and other terms specified on this page.

 
##### L S L S c r i p t s ( o p e n s o u r c e )

Each LSL script is its own program and compiles individually. Most of the scripts are licensed under the [GNU General Public License, version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0), but some of the more recently developed scripts are, in their unmodified form, licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

You can learn which script has which license by looking at each script's individual copyright notice. There you can also find the names of the various authors who contributed to the particular script over the years, and in which distribution the script was included prior to its release in the Peanut Collar Distribution, with a link to its history.

 
##### L S L S c r i p t s ( p r o p r i e t a r y )

If you are using a commercial product that was specifically marked as Peanut No. 9 it may also include proprietary content and services. Proprietary content can be distinguished by checking for limited digital rights (i.e. no modify permission) or looking at the contents description for "(c) virtualdisgrace.com".

By using a commercial product that was specifically marked as Peanut No. 9 you agree to the [End-User License Agreement of digital content and LSL scripts by virtualdisgrace.com for Second Life®](https://www.opencollar.at/eula-vd.html).

 
##### S o u n d s , P a r t i c l e s a n d T e x t u r e s

The creative content, that is linked in collar scripts as unique database identifiers, can be used freely, on condition that authorship is noted. This addresses all sounds and particle textures, which are either re-mixes of public domain resource, or original creations by Wendy Starfall, with the exception of the Chain particle texture, which is a modification based on original artwork by Grey Mars.

##### A n i m a t i o n s​

The ~stiff (neck) utility animation is an original creation by Toy Wylie and is licensed under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). The ~run utility animation is an upload of an original creation by Vanish Firecaster and may be used freely, on condition that his authorship is noted. The ~good and ~pet animations by Roenik Newell, the ~shock loop by Kabuki Ewing, as well as the ~crawl and crawl animations¹ by Misao Nakamura were utilized from public domain resource.

​The stock selection of poses in the Peanut Collar Distribution, which are called beg, cutie, doormat, kneel, nadu, nap, shy, spread, submit, table and tower, are licensed for use in Peanut No. 9 collars only. These poses can be distinguished by checking for limited digital rights (i.e. no modify or no copy permission) and whether "Wendy Starfall" is the creator or not.

While the stock selection of poses is limited to only Peanut No. 9 collars, you may freely use them as parts of other products that aren't collars, but you must not sell them as stand-alone poses, pose packs, or as part of some kind of pose compilation.

<sup>¹ Premium selection collars include specially made crawl animations by Surrealia Anatine that remain the property of VirtualDisgrace and its suppliers.</sup>

##### F r e e C o l l a r s a n d o t h e r A c c e s s o r y

​​Whereas these items are not actually a part of the Peanut Collar Distribution, they are often mistakenly understood as such.

​The many free collars that are available at Arcadia and Bondage and labeled as "OpenCollar Originals", can be passed on as gifts among friends, or for example within the context of a role play scenario among consenting partners, but they may not be re-sold for Linden Dollars, or real world currency.

Wendy continuously improved these collars over the years with texture tweaks, more economical primming, or modelling, and you might be able to considerably reduce your avatar render complexity when replacing a collar of the same style with a new one. Refactored models can be distinguished by having VariousArtists (the official OpenCollar 4.0, Six and Peanut full perm creative resource) as their creator.

As of early 2018 these collars have new animations added to them, which include single-frame variations of some of the exclusive poses² that are only available with collars that feature, in part or as a whole, the Virtual Disgrace™ premium content selection. These poses are for personal use, and you are also welcome to share them, but you may not sell them for Linden Dollars or real world currency.

​The free cuffs, that are sometimes included with free collars, are very similar to the Virtual Disgrace™ premium selection cuffs, with the exception that the free cuffs receive updates at a different time, and have fewer binding poses³ for the arms. Please see their [individual license text](https://www.opencollar.at/license-terms-for-the-virtual-disgrace-premium-cuffs.html) for details.

<sup>2 Multi-frame variations of poses have been created by Ash Ellsberg and remain the property of VirtualDisgrace and its suppliers.</sup>

<sup>3 All binding poses have been created by Grey Mars and remain the property of VirtualDisgrace and its suppliers.</sup>
