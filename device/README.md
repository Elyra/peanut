#### This directory has everything that you need for a full featured device!

When building, make sure that the core is made from six prims (including the root).

```
Link 1: auth.lsl
Link 2: dialog.lsl
Link 3: rlvsys.lsl
Link 4: settings.lsl
Link 5: anim.lsl; pet.lsl; <animation content if applicable>

Link 0 (root): com.lsl; root.lsl; <and all remaining programs>
```

The default link order doesn't have to be used, and there are no requirements for prim names, so don't worry about that, although if you want, you can put a custom name for your device in the root prim's description : )
